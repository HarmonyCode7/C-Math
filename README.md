# MATH FUNCTIONS EXPLORED USING C
Exploring Math functions like the sqrt(x) in C
This project aims to explore  a number of math functions is C.
Some of them utilise some Numerical techniques to provide approximations to solutions of some fumctions.

# Example SQRT(X) X - NSQUARED = 0
This checks the difference in X and a particular number squared for a close approximation for the root of X.
